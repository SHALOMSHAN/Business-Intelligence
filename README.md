# Business Intelligence

## Introduction 

Business Intelligence (BI) refers to the use of data analysis techniques, technologies, and applications to gather, integrate, analyze, and present business information. The goal of BI is to support business decision-making by providing insights and actionable intelligence from a range of data sources, including internal systems, external data, and third-party providers.

BI tools typically allow users to create reports, dashboards, and other visualizations that help them understand patterns and trends in their data. These tools can also help users identify areas of the business that need attention, and make informed decisions about how to allocate resources or pursue new opportunities.

Overall, BI enables businesses to gain a deeper understanding of their operations, customers, and market trends, and to use this information to make smarter, more informed decisions.
